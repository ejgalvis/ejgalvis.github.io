Elliot Galvis (he/him) is a library, digital scholarship, and cultural studies researcher interested in how information ecosystems shape social thought. He currently works as an adjunct Digital Scholarship Specialist at NYU Libraries and completed an M.A. in Digital Studies of Texts and Culture at the University of Chicago, where he worked with digital materials in the Preservation and Digitization divisions of the UChicago library. 

Elliot's current research compares linked data controlled vocabularies, looking at both production and access. Prior to this, his work includes conducting a computational text analysis of books challenged in the United States and developing a metadata application profile for a rich but sensitive digitized photography collection. 

While his cultural studies training started as an undergraduate in Classics informed by Gender and Sexuality Studies, Elliot's recent work has focused on information networks in the United States and cultural heritage based in and around South and Southeast Asia. Elliot is particularly interested in the intersections of horror theory, critical information studies, and queer theory as lenses for examining political and cultural imaginations.
